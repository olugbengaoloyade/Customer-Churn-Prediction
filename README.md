Project Overview

This project's primary goal was to develop a predictive model for accurate customer churn forecasting within the telecommunications sector. Leveraging historical customer data and machine learning methodologies, we identified and analyzed key features driving churn behavior.  The project centered on building a robust model to predict customers at high risk of service discontinuation.  Model performance was rigorously evaluated using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
